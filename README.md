# AvantTheme (theme for Omeka Classic)

AvantTheme provides:

* Layout, styling, and graphics for public facing pages
* Controls for simple search, subject search, and advanced search (replaces Omeka's search controls)
* [Galleries](http://swhplibrary.net/archive/gallery/)
* Support for the Lightbox feature (using the [AvantCustom](https://github.com/gsoules/AvantCustom) plugin)
